		<B>What is Kubernetes ?</B>

		Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services,
		that
		facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes
		services, support, and tools are widely available.`

		In case you are unaware of containerized application, you might be wondering ‘What does containerization mean?’.
		Containerization is basically a form of operating system virtualization, through which applications are run in
		isolated
		user spaces called containers, all using the same shared operating system (OS).
	<P>
		<B>Why Kubernetes?</B>

		The Docker adoption is still growing exponentially as more and more companies have started using it in
		production. It is
		important to use an orchestration platform to scale and manage your containers.

		Imagine a situation where you have been using Docker for a little while, and have deployed on a few different
		servers.
		Your application starts getting massive traffic, and you need to scale up fast; how will you go from 3 servers
		to 40
		servers that you may require? And how will you decide which container should go where? How would you monitor all
		these
		containers and make sure they are restarted if they die? This is where Kubernetes comes in.
